# Machine Learning (CS 412) Term Project

Sabanci University, 2024-2025 Fall.  
Machine Learning (CS 412) Course Term Project.

## Goal

This machine learning project addresses classification and regression tasks in Instagram data analysis, utilizing a dataset of 5,415 Instagram accounts, including detailed account profiles and metrics from 35 posts per account.

Both models will undergo a three-round evaluation process, where performance is tested against different test datasets provided sequentially by the lecturer. This multi-round testing approach ensures the robustness of the models against varying data distributions and helps validate their generalization capabilities.

The project leverages the rich feature set available in the dataset, including account biographical information, follower metrics, and historical post data, to create robust and accurate prediction models. The project allows for exploration and comparison of different machine learning algorithms to determine the most effective approach for each task.


## Regression

The regression task focuses on predicting the like count for individual Instagram posts, using both account characteristics and post-specific information such as captions and media type. The model's performance will be evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) on log-transformed like counts (log10).

## Classification

The classification task aims to develop a model that can accurately categorize Instagram accounts into 10 distinct categories: entertainment, food, travel, health and lifestyle, mom and children, fashion, tech, sports, art, and gaming. This model will be trained on a labeled subset of 2,743 accounts and evaluated using accuracy metrics.
